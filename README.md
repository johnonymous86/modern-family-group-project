# modern-family-group-project

## Description
This website was designed to pay homage to the tv show Modern Family and provide information about the show's background, cast, and the awards that it has received.

## Contributors
 ### Kativa Athalye- Home Page
 ### Amani Flood- Background Page
 ### Vicky Mak- Cast Page, Style Sheet
 ### John Caudill- Group leader, Awards Page
 ### Mary Sweisgood-Brisk- Responsivity, Animations, README file

 ## Challenges
  ### Logo allignment was not consistant between pages. Added it in the html file and it rectified the issue.
  ### Using branches for the first time was challenging. We were having issues with commits and knowing when we should merge so that the responsivity could be completed.
  ### Pages assigned while Mary Sweisgood-Brisk was unavailable due to a family emergency. She was assigned the task of making the site is more dynamic and responsive.
